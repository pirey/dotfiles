## setup / installation
+ `git clone https://github.com/pirey/dotfiles`
+ go to cloned directory, then `./bin/install [<dotfiles_dir>]`, where `dotfiles_dir` is directory where you clone this repo (default is `~/dotfiles`). **it will do these automatically for you**:
    - install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) if not already installed
    - create symlinks for all necessary dotfiles to your home directory
    - open vim and install vim plugins

## tmux
+ all configuration does not need any aditional action, except for the plugin
+ to use plugin, install tmux plugin manager (Optional)
    - `git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`
    - In tmux session, `prefix + I` to install listed plugins

## uninstall
+ you can remove all symlinks generated by `install` step above, by calling `./bin/uninstall` inside your `dotfiles` directory (note that this **will not** remove vim-plug and all installed vim plugins)
