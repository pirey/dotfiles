## local config

### git

The ~/.gitconfig.local file will be automatically included after the configurations from ~/.gitconfig, thus, allowing its content to overwrite or add to the existing Git configurations.

Note: Use ~/.gitconfig.local to store sensitive information such as the Git user credentials, e.g.:

```
[user]
    name = Yuri
    email = work.email@studio.com
```
